\begin{abstract}
Fault Localization (FL) is a precursor step to most Automated Program
Repair (APR) approaches, which fix the faulty statements identified by
the FL tools.
%Several Automated Program Repair (APR) approaches rely on Fault
%Localization tools to detect the faulty statements for fixing.
%
We present {\bf {\tool}}, a Deep Learning (DL)-based fault
localization approach supporting the detection of faulty statements in
one or multiple methods that need to be {\em modified accordingly in
  the same fix}.  Let us call them {\em co-change (CC) fixing
  locations} for a fault. We treat this FL problem as dual-task
learning with two models. The method-level FL model, \code{MethFL},
learns the methods to be fixed together. The statement-level FL model,
\code{StmtFL}, learns the statements to be co-fixed. Correct learning
in one model can benefit the other and vice versa. Thus, we
simultaneously train them with soft-sharing the models' parameters via
cross-stitch units to enable the propagation of the impact of
\code{MethFL} and \code{StmtFL} onto each other.
%In addition to the new solution with dual-task learning,
Moreover, we explore a novel feature for FL: the co-changed
statements. We also use Graph-based Convolution Network to integrate
different types of program dependencies.
%among statements.

Our empirical results show that {\tool} relatively improves over the
state-of-the-art statement-level FL baselines by locating
26.5\%--155.6\% more CC fixing statements. To evaluate its usefulness
in APR, we used {\tool} in combination with the state-of-the-art APR
tools. The results show that {\tool}+DEAR (the original FL
in DEAR replaced by {\tool}) and {\tool}+CURE improve relatively over
the original DEAR and Ochiai+CURE by 10.5\% and 42.9\% in terms of the
number of fixed bugs.

%Our empirical results on real-world datasets show that {\tool}

%baselines by locating 26.5\%--155.6\% more CC fixing statements. To
%evaluate its usefulness in APR, we used {\tool} in combination with

%show that {\tool}+DEAR (the original FL in DEAR replaced by {\tool})
%and {\tool}+CURE improve relatively over the original DEAR and

%Exploring this duality provides useful constraints for {\tool} to
%learn derive CC fixing statements.

%models.  The cross-stitch units
