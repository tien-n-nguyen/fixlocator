\section{Threats to Validity}
The threats of this paper come from the following aspects: 
(1) We evaluated our {\tool} on Java and Python code. The key modules in {\tool} are language-independent and can be applied to other types of programming languages. 
(2) The compared baselines and {\tool} require a dataset with test cases for generating code coverage information, run-time information, and failing traces, thus we only compared them on Defects4J and xx. In the future, we plan to test {\tool} on more types of datasets.
