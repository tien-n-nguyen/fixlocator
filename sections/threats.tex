\section{Threats to Validity}
The threats of this paper come from the following aspects: (1) We
evaluated our {\tool} on Java and Python code. The key modules in
{\tool} are language-independent and can be applied to other types of
programming languages.  (2) The compared baselines and {\tool} require
a dataset with test cases for generating code coverage information,
run-time information, and failing traces, thus we only compared them
on Defects4J. In the future, we plan to test {\tool} on more types of
datasets.  (3) The DeepFL is designed for method-level fault
localization. To compare it with {\tool} fairly, we use only part of
its features that are applicable to statement level fault
localization.  The other baselines CNNFL and DeepRL4FL can be
directly applied on statement-level FL. (4) To compare fairly, we evaluated the baselines using out proposed Hit-N@Set metrics. However, we also tested our {\tool} using the ranking metrics: Hit-N@Top-K. {\tool} is consistently better than all baselines in any metric.
