\subsubsection{Dataset}


We use a benchmark dataset Defects4J V2.0.0 \cite{defects4j} with 835
bugs from 7 Java projects. For each bug in a project $P$, Defects4J has
the faulty and fixed versions of the project. The faulty and fixed
versions contain the corresponding test suite relevant to the
bug. With the \code{Diff} comparison between faulty and fixed versions
of a project, we can identify the faulty statements. Specifically, for
a bug in $P$, Defects4J has a separate copy of $P$ but with
only the corresponding test suite revealing the bug. For example,
$P_1$, a version of $P$, passes a test suite $T_1$. Later, a bug $B_1$
in $P_1$ is identified. After debugging, $P_1$ has an evolved test
suite $T_2$ detecting the bug. In this case, Defects4J has a separate
copy of the buggy $P_1$ with a single bug, together with the test
suite $T_2$. Similarly, for bug $B_2$, Defects4J has a copy of $P_2$
together with $T_3$ (evolving from $T_2$), and so on. We do not use
the whole T of all test suites for training/testing. For
within-project setting, we test one bug $B_i$ with test suite
$T_{(i+1)}$ by training on all other bugs in $P$. We conducted all the
experiments on a server with 16 core CPU and a single Nvidia A100 GPU.
