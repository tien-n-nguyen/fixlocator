\section{Conclusion}

We present {\tool}, a novel deep learning-based fault localization
approach that aims to locate co-change fixing locations within one or
multiple methods. The key ideas of {\tool} include (1) a new
dual-learning model of method- and statement-level fault localization
to detect CC fixing locations; (2) a novel graph-based representation
learning with co-change relations among methods and statements. Our
empirical results show that {\tool} outperforms the studied DL-based
FL baseline models, especially when dealing with multiple CC fixing
statements.
