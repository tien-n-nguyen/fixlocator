Let us start with a real-world example on the bug fixes that
require multiple changes to multiple statements in different methods.
Figure~\ref{fig:motiv} shows a bug in Defects4J dataset. The bug
occurred when the method call to \code{setTagAsStrict} did not
consider the first output in its arguments. Therefore, for fixing, a
developer adds a new argument in the method \code{toSource} at line
19, and uses that argument in the method call \code{setTagAsStrict
  (firstOutput,...)} at line 23. Because the method \code{toSource} at
line 19 was changed, the two callers at line 3 of the method
\code{toSource} (line 1) and at line 14 of the method \code{toSource}
(line 12) need to be changed accordingly.

%This is a bug from Defects4J data that has three methods need to be fixed at the same time. The bug is caused by doing the method call $setTagAsStrict$ without checking if it is the first output. To fix this bug, firstly, for the method C, we need to add one more parameter $firstOutput$ for the method call $setTagAsStrict$. Then, for the method A and B, because they call the method C or override the method C, when adding a new parameter in the method C, they all need to do the same thing. We need to add $inputSeqNum == 0$ in method A and add $true$ in method B when calling the method C.

%In this bug, there are multiple statements that need to be fixed and they located in three different methods. Also, when analyzing the co-change information, the method A and method C have been fixed together before in the commit history. 

\noindent {\bf Observation 1. [Co-Change Fixing Locations]} As seen in
this example, the changes to fix this bug involve multiple faulty
statements that are dependent on one another. Fixing only one of the
faulty statements will not make the program pass the previously
failing test(s). For an APR model to work, an FL tool needs to point
out all of those faulty statements to be changed in the same fix. For
effective manually fixing by developers, an FL tool also needs point
out all faulty statements to be fixed at once. Otherwise, (s)he must
find the missing locations or waste time on incorrect ones.

\noindent {\bf Observation 2. [Multiple Faulty Methods]} As seen, this
bug requires the changes to three different methods at the same time.
It is important for an FL tool to connect and identify these multiple
faulty statements in potentially different methods.

Traditional FL approaches~\cite{zhang-fse09,ICICA-10} using program
analysis (PA), e.g., execution flow analysis, could identify all of
those statements in the same fix due to their caller/callee
relations. Spectrum-based~\cite{tarantula05,Ochiai},
mutation-based~\cite{MUSE,papadakis2012using,Metallaxis}),
statistic-based~\cite{liblit-pldi05}, and machine learning (ML)-based
FL approaches~\cite{DeepFL,icse21-fl} could implicitly learn the
program dependencies for FL purpose. However, despite their successes,
the non-PA FL approaches {\em do not support the detection of multiple
  locations that need to be changed in the same fix for a bug, i.e.,
  Co-Change (CC) Fixing Locations}.
%
The spectrum-based and ML-based FL models return a ranked list
of suspicious statements according to the corresponding suspiciousness
scores. In this example, the lines 3, 14, 18, 22, and the other lines
({\em e.g.}, 5, 13, 21 and 25) are executed in the same passing or
failing test cases, thus~assigned the same scores by
spectrum-based and mutation-based FL approaches. A user would not
be informed on what lines need to be fixed together. Those non-PA,
especially ML-based FL approaches do not have a mechanism to detect
CC fixing locations.

In this work, we aim to advance the level of deep learning (DL)-based
FL approaches to detect CC fixing locations. However, it is not
trivial. A solution of assuming the top-$k$ suspicious statements from
a FL tool as CC fixing locations does not work because even being the
most suspicious, those statements might not need to be changed in the
same fix. In this example, all of the above lines with the same
suspiciousness scores would confuse a fixer.

Moreover, another naive solution would be to use a method-level FL
tool to detect multiple faulty methods first and then use a
statement-level FL tool to detect the statements within each faulty
method. As we will show in our experiment, the inaccuracy of the first
phase of detecting faulty methods will have a confounding effect in
the overall performance in detecting CC fixing statements.
