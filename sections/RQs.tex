\subsection{Research Questions}

For evaluation, we seek to answer the following research questions:

\noindent\textbf{RQ1. Comparison with State-of-the Art Deep Learning
  (DL)-based Approaches.}  How well does {\tool} perform compared with
the state-of-the-art DL-based fault localization approaches?

\noindent\textbf{RQ2. Impact Analysis of Dual Learning.} 
How does the dual-learning scheme affect {\tool}'s performance?

\noindent\textbf{RQ3. Sensitivity Analysis.} How do various factors affect the overall performance of {\tool}?


\noindent\textbf{RQ4. Evaluation on Python Projects.} How does {\tool}
perform on Python projects?
