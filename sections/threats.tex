\subsubsection{Threats to Validity}
%Our empirical evaluation has the following threats to validity.
(1) We evaluated {\tool} on Java and Python. Our modules are
applicable to other languages. (2) The baselines and our tool require
test cases to generate code coverage and run-time data,
thus we compared them only on two datasets.
%We plan to evaluate it on more types of datasets.
(3) DeepFL is designed for method-level FL. For comparison, we use
only its features applicable to statement-level FL.
Other baselines work directly at the statement level.
%(4) For comparison, we evaluated the baselines using Hit-N metric,
%and we also evaluated {\tool} using the ranking metric
%Hit-N@Top-$K$.
(4) In 501 bugs in BugsInPy, the third-party tool cannot process 60
of them. (5) We focus on CC fixing statements, instead of 
methods, due to bug fixing purpose.

%since an APR tool needs the statement-level~FL.

%We will measure our tool's capability in method-level FL in future.

%{\tool} is consistently better than all baselines in any metric.
