%we need to talk about the newly fse lingming's paper, code not available, and also their results on benchmark is even lower than deepFL.


Lingming's paper has code now, but we won't have time to implement it and also it is designed for method ranking, our approach is proposed for statement-level. Their model is designed for method-level fault localization, aiming to provide rankings of faulty methods, which is different from our work.

also talk about the spectrum and mutation work, also the predicates-based approaches (icse'21 newly work).
