\section{Conclusion}

We present {\tool}, a novel DL-based FL approach that aims to locate
co-change fixing locations within one or multiple methods. The key
ideas of {\tool} include (1) a new dual-learning model of method- and
statement-level fault localization to detect CC fixing locations; (2)
a novel graph-based representation learning with co-change relations
among methods and statements; (3) novel feature in co-change
methods/statements. Our empirical results show that
%{\tool} outperforms the studied DL-based FL baselines, {\em advancing
%  FL in dealing with multiple CC fixing statements}.
%
{\tool} relatively improves over the state-of-the-art
FL baselines by locating more {\em CC fixing statements} from 26.5\% to
155.6\%, and help APR tools improve its bug-fixing accuracy.

%, and reduces the statements to be examined by 22\%--30\%.
