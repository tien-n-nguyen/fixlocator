\noindent {\bf Running Time.} As seen in Table~\ref{tab:time}, except
for DeepFL (using a basic neural network), 
%(machine learning, not deep learning)
the other approaches have similar training and prediction
time. Importantly, prediction time is just a few seconds, making
{\tool} suitable for interactive use.

%Training time cost: CNN-FL: 4 hours, DeepFL: 5 minutes (machine
%learning, not deep learning), DeepRL4FL: 7 hours, FixLocator: 6
%hours. Prediction time cost: CNN-FL: 2 seconds, DeepFL: 1 second,
%DeepRL4FL: 4 seconds, and FixLocator: 2 seconds.
