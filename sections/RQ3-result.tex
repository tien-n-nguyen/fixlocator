\subsubsection{Impact of the Method-Level (ML) Features and ML Co-change Relation}

%\subsubsection{{\bf Impact of the method-level (ML) features and ML co-change r%elation}}

Among all the method-level features/attributes of {\tool}, the {\em
feature of co-change relations among methods has the largest impact}.
Specifically, without the co-change feature among methods, Hit-1 is
decreased by 8.3\%. Moreover, the {\it method structure feature,
represented as AST, has the second largest impact}. Without the
method structure feature, Hit-1 is decreased by 7.8\%.

Among the last two method-level features with least impact, the method
content feature has less impact than the similar-buggy-method
feature. This shows that {\em the bugginess nature of a method and
similar ones has more impact than the tokens of the method itself}.

%Moreover, the {\em feature of co-change relations among methods has}
%{\em the largest impact} among all ML features. Specifically, without
%the co-change feature among methods, Hit-1 is decreased by 8.3\%.

%and EXAM score is increased by 28.6\%.
%This result shows that {\em our novel feature of co-change relation is
%important for detecting CC fixing locations}.

%it can decrease the results of Hit-1@Set by xx\% and increase the Exam
%score by xx\%.

\subsubsection{Impact of the Statement-Level (SL) Features and SL Co-change Relation}

Among all the statement-level features, {\it Code Coverage
has the largest impact}. Without {\it Code Coverage} feature,
Hit-1 is decreased by 10.1\%.
%and EXAM score is increased by 28.6\%.
%the performance is decreased by 10.1\% in terms of Hit-1@Set and is
%increased by 28.6\% in terms of EXAM score.
%The subtree feature has more impact than the variable feature.
%
The co-change relations among statements have the second largest
impact among all SL features/attributes. Specifically, without
the co-change relations among statements, Hit-1 is decreased by 9.3\%.

%and EXAM score is increased by 57.1\%. Thus, {\em the novel feature of
%co-change relation is also very important for detecting CC fixing
%statements}.




%\underline{Impact of the depth level of stack trace.} 

\subsubsection{Impact of the Depth Level of Stack Trace}

As seen in Table~\ref{fig:rq3-2},
%the depth level of stack trace can have a large impact on the
%performance. Specifically,
{\tool} can achieve the best performance when depth=10. The cases with
depth= 5 or 15 can bring into analysis too few or too many irrelevant
methods, causing more noises to the model.
Thus, we chose depth=10 for our experiments.

%Thus, the results for depth=5 or 15 are lower than the ones of depth=10.



\input{sections/discussions}


%Our results show that all features and components in {\tool} have
%impacts on its performance.
