\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present {\tool}, a novel deep learning based fault localization approach that aims to locate multiple statements within one method or cross-methods relevant to a bug. The key ideas of {\tool} are (1) a new simultaneous dual-learning of method- and statement- level fault localization to improve statement-level fault localization; (2) a novel graph-based representation learning with co-change relations among methods and statements for locating relevant fix locations. Our empirical results show that {\tool} can outperform the studied baselines on locating buggy statements, especially when dealing with multiple relevant buggy statements.
