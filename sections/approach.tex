\section{Approach}
\subsection{Approach Overview}

In \tool, we have three main steps to do the fault localization. We want to introduce them as follow:

{\bf Step 1. Data Preprocess.} \tool accepts the java project with all the related test cases as the input for the whole tool. In this step, \tool firstly preprocesses the input into features and graphs in three main directions. And then \tool groups these features and graphs into two big sets for statement-level and method-level fault localization. \tool generates features include: 1) Method content (sequence of sub-tokens); 2) Abstract Syntax Tree (whole method); 3) Most similar buggy method; 4) Code coverage information; 5) Sub-AST (single statement); 6) Variables. \tool generates graphs include: 1) Stack traces; 2) execution path (method level); 3) execution path (statement level); 4) Co-change relationship (method level); 5) Co-change relationship (statement level); 6) Program Dependency Graph (PDG). After having these features, we group the feature 1), 2), and 3) with graphs 1), 2), and 4) as one set for the method-level fault localization usage while we group the rest features and graphs as one set for the statement-level fault localization.

{\bf Step 2. Feature Representation Learning} In this step, \tool uses different technologies to combine and learn the representations from the features and graphs generated in the last step. 

For the method-level, \tool collects the stack traces with the depth of 10 with directional edges $E_m^s$ and expands it by adding the execution path and co-change relationships. As for the execution path, \tool starts to find them from the stack traces with the depth of 10 and collects all the methods within ten steps from the crash position in the stack trace. \tool adds these methods by adding a new type of directional edge $E_m^e$ to the stack trace. As for the co-change relationships, \tool collects all co-change information from the repository commit history and adds them to the stack trace with the new type of non-directional edges $E^c$. If a set of methods $M$ has been changed together in previous commits in the repository, \tool regards them as the co-change information. There will be one non-directional edge $E^c$ between every two methods in this set. Because the stack trace graph is a directional graph, to add them to the stack trace graph, we make the non-directional edge $E^c$ become a two-directional edge $E_m^c$ (e.g.$method_A -> method_B$ and $method_B -> method_A$). After having the combined graph $G_m$, for each node, \tool uses RNN model \cite{} to learn the representation of the method content and uses the tree-based model TreeCaps \cite{} to learn the representation of the AST and the most similar buggy method. 

Similar to the method-level, on the statement-level, \tool uses TreeCaps to learn the representation for the sub-AST as one of the node features. And \tool uses the PDG as the base graph and adds the co-change relationship and execution path to build the combined graph $G_s$ in the same way as the method-level. The different features are the code coverage information and variables. For the code coverage information, \tool collects the test cases running results for a statement. If the test case $t_i$ passes the statement, \tool uses $1$ to represent the code coverage information $c_i$ for the test case $t_i$ while \tool uses $0$ to represent $c_i$ when the test case $t_i$ does not pass the statement. By collecting them together, \tool has the code coverage information feature as $<c_1, c_2, ..., c_i>$. And for the variables, \tool collects all variables $v$ that appear in the statement, and for each variable, \tool uses the variable name and type to represent it. By linking these variables as a sequence, \tool uses the RNN model to learn the representation for the variable feature.

{\bf Step 3. Multi-tasking Fault Localization} After having the feature representations from the last step, \tool uses a multi-tasking framework to do the fault localization. In the framework, there are two tasks: method-level fault localization and method-level fault localization. Among them, statement-level fault localization is the primary goal for the multi-tasking framework.

For the method-level fault localization, \tool uses the GCN model \cite{} to do the binary classification $C_m$ for each node based on the combined graph $G_m$. If the method is faulty, the GCN model will classify the node as $1$ while the GCN model classifies the node to $0$ when the method is non-faulty. Like the statement level, \tool uses the other GCN model to classify $C_s$ on the statement level based on the combined graph $G_s$.

When doing the training, \tool learns the classification on both method-level and state-level and does the soft parameter sharing between the two models to make these two GCN models learn more features from both levels. But when making the prediction, because the statement-level fault localization is the primary goal, \tool only picks the statement-level fault localization results as the final results. Thus, \tool regards all the statements marked as faulty as the model output statement set, which contains the statements predicted to be fixed together in this fault.
