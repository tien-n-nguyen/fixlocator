\subsubsection{Threats to Validity}
%Our empirical evaluation has the following threats to validity.
(1) We evaluated {\tool} on Java and Python code. Our key modules can
be applied to other types of programming languages.  (2) The compared
baselines and {\tool} require a dataset with test cases for generating
code coverage information, run-time information, and failing traces,
thus we only compared them on two datasets. We plan to evaluate it on
more types of datasets. (3) DeepFL is designed for method-level
FL. For comparison, we use only its features that are
applicable to statement-level FL. The other baselines
directly work on statement-level FL. (4) For comparison, we
evaluated the baselines using Hit-N@Set metric, and we also evaluated
{\tool} using the ranking metric Hit-N@Top-$K$. We focus on CC fixing
statements, rather than faulty methods because an APR tool needs the
statement-level FL. We will measure our tool's capability in
method-level FL in future.

%{\tool} is consistently better than all baselines in any metric.
